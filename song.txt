Let me be your hero
Would you dance, if I asked you to dance?
Would you run, and never look back?
Would you cry, if you saw me cryin'?
And would you save my soul tonight?
Would you tremble, if I touched your lips?
Would you laugh?
Oh, please, tell me this
Now, would you die for the one you loved?
Hold me in your arms tonight
I can be your hero, baby
I can kiss away the pain
I will stand by you forever
You can take my very breath away
Would you swear that you'll always be mine?
Or would you lie?
Would you run and hide?
Am I in too deep?
Have I lost my mind?
I don't care, you're here tonight
I can be your hero, baby
I can kiss away the pain
I will stand by you forever
You can take my breath away
Oh, I just wanna hold you
I just want to hold you, oh, yeah
Am I in too deep?
Have I lost my mind?
Well, I don't care, you're here tonight
I can be your hero, baby
I can kiss away the pain, oh, yeah
I will stand by you forever
You can take my breath away
And I can be your hero
I can kiss away the pain
And I will stand by you forever
You can take my breath away
You can take my breath away
I can be your hero
Can't you see you're not ready
My arms are getting heavy
From the weight of the world
It's up to me and I'm getting
Sweaty is it too much to hold
A thousand voices
Whisper noise
They plan my fall from grace
Whoa oh
I know
Say you want a hero
You don't
Say you want a savior
Pull you off the ground
Then you wanna blame me
When you're falling down
Whoa oh
I know
Don't wanna be your hero
Oh no
When's it gonna sink in
That we're sinkin' and fallin' apart
'Cause love don't last in the dark
Can't you see you got old
You waited too long and you let time go
Placed your bets when it all comes down
Fold your cards and you blame the house
A thousand voices
Whisper noise
They plan my fall from grace
Whoa oh
I know
Say you want a hero
You don't
Say you want a savior
Pull you off the ground
Then you wanna blame me
When you're falling down
Whoa oh
I know
Don't wanna be your hero
Oh no
When's it gonna sink in
That we're sinkin' and fallin' apart
'Cause love don't last in the dark
Whoa oh, whoa oh
Love don't last in the dark
Whoa oh, whoa oh
Can't you see you got old
You waited too long and you let time go
Placed your bets when it all comes down
Fold your cards and you blame the house
